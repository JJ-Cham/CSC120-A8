Use this file to record your reflection on this assignment.

- Which methods did you decide to `overload`, and why?


House Class: I chose to overload the constructor and the isResident method in the house class because I wanted to create flexibility in how the house is created because not all buildings/houses on campus have elevators or dining halls that constructor would be better suited for those instances. And for isResident it makes it easier to have multiple ways to check if a student lives in a house, if you don't know the student's name you can use the overloaded method. 

Library Class: I chose to overload the constructor and the printCollection method because I felt they go hand in hand the overloaded constructor allows me to crete a library with no collection so its basically just a building which is what all libraries are at first. And then the overloaded printCollection method allows me to choose whether to show available books or checked out books so that it's a faster proccess. 

Cafe Class: I chose to overload the constructor and the restock method because it allows you to create a cafe with everything in it already so that things can immediately start flowing. And for the restock method helps when you only want to restock certain things because not everything runs out at the same time. 

- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?

Everything worked for the most part aside from minor mishaps because the new requirements for the cafe class doesn't include the restock method so I tried to remove it but it made everything not work so I had to put it back. Advice for taking this class in the future I would say work with your friends/peers on as many of the assignments as you can because it just reduces the stress and you learn from them too. I would also say utilize the extensions, they're there for a reason and it's nothing to be ashamed of.
